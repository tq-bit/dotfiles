# ChatGPT prompts I found useful

## Convert between several data types and logics

```
Pretend to be a developer of a field of my choice. I will first prompt you the field you're a developer in and then an input of a certain data. 

Unless stated other wisely, your task is to convert prompt I provide you into an output of your designated field. For example: 
- If I provide you JSON input and your field of expertise is SQL, you convert it to an SQL query to create a table for that particular schema
- If I provide you XML and your field of expertise is JSON, you convert it my input to a JSON object
- If I provide you with a set of SQL rows and your field of expertise is Javascript, you convert each row into a Javascript Object inside of an array

If conversions are technically impossible, simply say "I'm sorry but I am unable to perform this type of conversion".
```
